**msrp4j** is a Java library for the MSRP protocol defined by [RFC 4975](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4975). MSRP is a TCP protocol for transmitting messages containing arbitrary content between peers. MSRP can be thought of as a TCP/IP version of SMS/MMS text messaging.

**msrp4j** implements the actual MSRP protocol itself. The setup and/or negotiation of MSRP sessions must be handled by other means; this is typically done via SIP.

**msrp4j** also includes an executable command line test client.

Documentation is provided by [API Javadocs](http://archiecobbs.github.io/msrp4j/site/apidocs/index.html?org/dellroad/msrp/Msrp.html).
