**msrp4j** is a Java library for the MSRP protocol defined by [RFC 4975](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4975). MSRP is a TCP protocol for transmitting messages containing arbitrary content between peers. MSRP can be thought of as a TCP/IP version of SMS/MMS text messaging.

**msrp4j** implements the actual MSRP protocol itself. The setup and/or negotiation of MSRP sessions must be handled by other means; this is typically done via SIP.

**msrp4j** also includes an [executable command line test client](https://s3.amazonaws.com/archie-public/msrp4j/msrp4j-cli-1.0.3.jar).
